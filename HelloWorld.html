    <p>A former drug trafficker and addict, Chipp struggled in the streets of his hometown until a man called Tsuyoshi
        took him into his care.
        He trained Chipp in the arts of Ninjutsu until his death at the hands of a syndicate.</p>
    <p>Chipp is portrayed as a muscular, yet slender young man with red eyes and earrings, and with white hair sticking
        out in all directions. He invariably wears a black tank top—which resembles a leather jacket—tucked into a pair
        of white trousers with two straps on the left hip, shod in high closed shoes with large buckles. He is equipped
        with a short, curved silver blade attached to his right wristband that goes up along his arm to his shoulder.
